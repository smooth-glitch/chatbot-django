# Django Chatbot with Keras and TensorFlow ü§ñ

![Chatbot](https://via.placeholder.com/728x90.png)

## Overview

Welcome to the **Django Chatbot** project! This is a web-based AI chatbot powered by deep learning models built using **Keras** and **TensorFlow**. Our chatbot is designed to understand user inputs and provide intelligent, context-aware responses based on trained datasets using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** algorithms. 

The backend is crafted with **Django** and **Django Rest Framework (DRF)**, while the frontend is built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

This project demonstrates the integration of deep learning models into web applications to create intelligent conversational agents.

## Model Training üìö

The chatbot's responses are powered by a machine learning model trained on a dataset of conversational intents. Customize this dataset based on the chatbot's domain (e.g., customer service, educational assistant).

### Steps for Model Training:

1. **Prepare Dataset**:
   - Create a dataset (`intents.json`) containing intents, patterns, and responses.
   
   Example:
   ```json
   {
       "intents": [
           {
               "tag": "greeting",
               "patterns": ["Hello", "Hi", "How are you?", "Is anyone there?"],
               "responses": ["Hello!", "Hi, how can I assist you today?"]
           },
           {
               "tag": "goodbye",
               "patterns": ["Bye", "See you later", "Goodbye"],
               "responses": ["Goodbye!", "See you soon!"]
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Use **Scikit-learn** for tokenizing, lemmatizing, and vectorizing patterns.
   - Apply **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for text transformation.

3. **Train the Model**:
   - Build a classification model using **Keras** and **TensorFlow**. Example:
     ```python
     from keras.models import Sequential
     from keras.layers import Dense

     model = Sequential()
     model.add(Dense(128, input_shape=(input_shape,), activation='relu'))
     model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
     model.add(Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'))
     ```

4. **Save the Model**:
   - Save the trained model to a file (`chatbot_model.h5`):
     ```python
     model.save('chatbot_model.h5')
     ```

5. **Loading the Model**:
   - Load the trained model when the server runs to process user input and generate responses.
