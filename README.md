# Django Chatbot with Keras and TensorFlow

![Chatbot](https://via.placeholder.com/728x90.png)

## Overview

The **Django Chatbot** project is a web-based AI chatbot powered by deep learning models built using **Keras** and **TensorFlow**. The chatbot is capable of understanding user input and responding with appropriate answers based on trained datasets using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** algorithms. The backend is built using **Django** and **Django Rest Framework (DRF)** to manage the API, while the frontend is built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

This project aims to demonstrate how deep learning models can be integrated into web applications to provide intelligent conversational agents.

## Features

### 1. Chatbot Features
- **Intelligent Responses**: The chatbot provides intelligent and context-aware responses based on trained datasets.
- **Natural Language Processing**: NLP techniques are used to preprocess the user input for better understanding.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Trained using **Keras** and **TensorFlow** for classification and text analysis.
- **Customizable Responses**: The dataset used for training can be easily modified to include new categories and responses.

### 2. Backend API
- **Django Rest Framework (DRF)**: Provides a RESTful API to interact with the chatbot.
- **Scalable API**: Can be extended for integrating with other applications or mobile apps.
- **JSON-Based Responses**: The chatbot returns responses in JSON format, making it easy to integrate into frontend applications.

### 3. Frontend Features
- **Real-Time Chat Interface**: A user-friendly web interface that allows real-time chatting with the chatbot.
- **JavaScript and AJAX**: Enables smooth and asynchronous communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**
- **Django**
- **Django Rest Framework (DRF)**
- **Keras**
- **TensorFlow**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Virtual Environment** (Recommended)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/django-chatbot.git
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # For Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run database migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Train the chatbot model (see **Model Training** section below).

6. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Usage

1. **Train the Model**: Prepare and train your chatbot model using the dataset (see **Model Training** section).
2. **Chat Interface**: Use the web-based chat interface to interact with the chatbot.
3. **Real-Time Responses**: The chatbot processes the input and returns intelligent responses in real time.
4. **API Interaction**: You can also interact with the chatbot via the API using tools like Postman or through other frontend applications.

## Model Training

The chatbot's responses are powered by a machine learning model trained on a dataset of conversational intents. You can customize this dataset based on the chatbot's domain of expertise (e.g., customer service, educational assistant).

### Steps for Model Training:

1. **Prepare Dataset**:
   - Prepare a dataset (`intents.json`) containing intents, patterns, and responses. Each intent has a category, a list of patterns (user inputs), and corresponding responses.
   
   Example:
   ```json
   {
       "intents": [
           {
               "tag": "greeting",
               "patterns": ["Hello", "Hi", "How are you?", "Is anyone there?"],
               "responses": ["Hello!", "Hi, how can I assist you today?"]
           },
           {
               "tag": "goodbye",
               "patterns": ["Bye", "See you later", "Goodbye"],
               "responses": ["Goodbye!", "See you soon!"]
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Use **Scikit-learn** for tokenizing, lemmatizing, and vectorizing the patterns.
   - Apply **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to transform the text into feature vectors for training.

3. **Train the Model**:
   - Build a classification model using **Keras** and **TensorFlow**. You can use a simple neural network with **Dense layers** for classification.
   - Example Model:
     ```python
     from keras.models import Sequential
     from keras.layers import Dense

     model = Sequential()
     model.add(Dense(128, input_shape=(input_shape,), activation='relu'))
     model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
     model.add(Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'))
     ```

4. **Save the Model**:
   - After training the model, save it in a file (`chatbot_model.h5`) so it can be loaded for future use:
     ```python
     model.save('chatbot_model.h5')
     ```

5. **Loading the Model**:
   - When the server runs, load the trained model and use it to process user input and generate responses.
